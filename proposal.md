## Description
I will create a short visual novel. This is relevant to digital arts & media because it's a form of visual storytelling that requires programming to be made. 

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Clickable objects: things you can click on for additional information, likely in the form of an internal monologue, example: you click on a book, and you get a little bit of insight into what it's about and what the character thinks about it.
- Feature 2
	- Multiple endings: have 2 ending
- Feature 3 
	- Branching dialgue choices: player choice impacts plot

## Challenges
- For clickable objects I need to leaern the concepts: clickable areas, event handling, hotspots, and conditionals
- I will need to learn branching logic to create 2 different endings
- For branching dialogue choices I need to focus on dialogue trees, branching paths, variables, and conditionals (if/else)

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome for this project is to have a finished demo with quality storytelling, finished assets, and visuals.The game should run everything and the features smoothly without issues or bugs.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal viable outcome for this project is to have a finished demo that runs smoothly without bugs and has all the features. The art doesn't have to be pretty and the script can be a little rough.
