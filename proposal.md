## Description
I will create a short visual novel. This is relevant to digital arts & media because it's a form of visual storytelling that requires programming to be made.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Looping/Replayability
- Feature 2
	- Multiple endings: have 2 ending
- Feature 3 
	- Branching dialogue choices: player choice impacts ending

## Challenges
- I will have to make sure to have a structure and game loop logic
- I will need to learn branching logic to create 2 different endings
- For branching dialogue choices I need to focus on dialogue trees, branching paths, variables, and conditionals (if/else)

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome for this project is to have a finished demo with quality storytelling, finished assets, and visuals.The game should run everything and the features smoothly without issues or bugs.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal viable outcome for this project is to have a finished demo that runs smoothly without bugs and has all the features. The art doesn't have to be pretty and the script can be a little rough.
